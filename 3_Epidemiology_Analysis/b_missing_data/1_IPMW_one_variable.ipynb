While presented in the simple case where we wanted a single mean, these weights are also valuable when used in conjunction with other inverse probability weights in analyses. Additionally, these weights are one way to deal with missing data under the missing at random assumption. Please view other tutorials for more information on functions in *zEpid*\n",
