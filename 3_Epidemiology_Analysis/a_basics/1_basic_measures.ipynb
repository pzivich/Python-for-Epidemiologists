    "# Measures\n",
    "This tutorial describes some of the basic measures used in epidemiology. For the purpose of this tutorial, we will refer to these measures as measures of association, since we will not believe that these observation measures reflect measure of effect. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the following example, we will use a sample data set included with *zEpid*. We will be interested in antiretroviral therapy (``art``) on all-cause mortality (``dead``). This data set will be referred to throughout the remainder of the guide. The specific measures of association we will calculate will refer to the measure at 45-weeks. We will defined ``art`` as $A$ where $A=1$ for treated with ART and $A=0$ for not treated with ART, and ``dead`` as $Y$ where $Y=1$ is died by 45-weeks and $Y=0$ is survived until 45-weeks. $\\Pr(.)$ denotes the probability function, with $\\Pr(C|D)$ as the conditional probability of $C$ given $D$, and $\\hat{\\Pr}(.)$ is the estimated probability"
