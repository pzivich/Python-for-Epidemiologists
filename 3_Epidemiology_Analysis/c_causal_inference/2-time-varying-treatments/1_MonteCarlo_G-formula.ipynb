    "# G-formula: Monte Carlo Estimator\n",
    "The Monte-Carlo g-formula is specifically meant to address the problem of time-varying confounding. Time-varying confounders are a particular pain for causal inference. Depending on the causal structure of the world, time-varying confounders exist as both a confounder and mediator. As such, conditional models have no solution for time-varying confounding. In 1986, James Robins proposed the brilliant idea of the Monte-Carlo g-formula as a way around this. Essentially, we use regression models to estimate the relationship between variables over time. From these regression models, we take a sample of our data from baseline and simulate their outcomes over time. The g-formula is a key link between two areas of epidemiology; mathematical modeling and phenomenological epidemiology (statistical). The g-formula has always fascinated me and I believe is the fundamental method for causal inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial details how to use the g-formula to estimate risks under time-varying treatment regimes. To estimate the marginal risk, we will use g-computation algorithm estimated via a Monte Carlo procedure. For a detailed introduction, please refer to the listed references.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following example, use a simulated data set that comes with zEpid. For our example, we are interested in the time-varying risk of death under several different treatment strategies. Specifically, our cohort is of HIV-infected individuals and we are interested in different anti-retroviral treatment (ART) strategies. First we will load the time-varying data. "

    "As you can see from the first few observations, the data set is set up to have multiple rows per individual. Specifically, we row corresponds to and individual over a specific period of time. For example, the first row details ID 2 for the first week (0 - 1) of follow-up. For the Monte-Carlo g-formula, the data set should be broken into these time periods. This allows us to fit successive models to estimate time-varying treatments over time. The division of rows into discrete intervals is left up to the user to decide. More finely divided levels will produce smoother risk curves, but may not be warranted based on the collected data. For our example, we are using week time-periods which will results in somewhat choppy of survival curves\n",

    "## Estimating the Exposure/Treatment Model\n",
    "Next we will estimate the exposure/treatment model. This model predicts when an individual receives treatment. Specfically, this model is used to model the natural course. The natural course is the observation of the world as it is. We will use the natural course predictions to see if any of our models are grossly misspecified. \n",
    "\n",
    "To fit the exposure model, we will call the `MonteCarloGFormula` class and specify the function `exposure_model()` to fit a model that predicts the exposure (`art`) over time. Based on substantive knowledge, we believe that ART is given based on gender, age, baseline CD4 T-cell count, current CD4 T-cell count, baseline viral load, current viral load, and time. We will model age, CD4 count, and time as cubic to impose less restrictive modeling assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we are going to specify the optional `restriction` argument. This argument is restrict who is included in the regression model. Specifically, we will be assuming that once as individual is given ART, they remain on ART for all future follow-up visits (intent-to-treat assumption). We specify the restriction argument as `\"g['lag_art']==0\"`. This the `MonteCarloGFormula`, that exposure model should only be estimated to observations where the individual has not been previously treated with ART (i.e. `lag_art == 0`). This option should be used depending on your assumptions of how the natural course proceeds.  \n",
    "\n",
    "*Note*: as you may have noticed, the `restriction` option uses `g`. This `g` is a magic-g. Inside the `MonteCarloGFormula`, it refers to the input data frame as `g`. The restriction argument uses Python's `eval()` to evaulate the input of `restriction` and other arguments. Withouth the magic-g, `MonteCarloGFormula` will NOT recognize the input as the data set. "

    "To add time-varying confounder models, the `add_covariate_model` function is used. This function can be repeatedly called to add an arbitrary number of time-varying confounder models. The arguments we will specify are as follows; `label`, `covariate`, `model`, and `var_type`. `label` tells the Monte-Carlo procedure what order to fit the time-varying confounder models in. This is necessary since they cannot occur simultaneously in our framework. Based on our knowledge, we set detected viral load to be the first time-varying confounder to be estimated. `covariate` tells `MonteCarloGFormula` which variable we are modeling. `model` is the predictive model we are using to esitimate the `covariate`. Finally, `var_type` tells `MonteCarloGFormula` that the time-varying confounder is a binary variable. Currently only binary (logistic regression) and continuous (linear regression) time-varying confounders are supported"

    "From this plot, we can see that delaying ART treatment until CD4 T-cell count is below 200 is better than the counterfactual where no one is treated with ART. However, treating everyone prevents many more deaths. Therefore, we would conclude that giving ART immediately after diagnosis should be the current practice (this is current practice due to real studies, which inspired this simulated data set).\n",

    "## Confidence Intervals\n",
    "One remark before closing, confidence intervals can be time consuming to calculate. Specifically, we need to use a bootstrap procedure. I will provide an example of this in a future update (specifically RD 95% CL for each time point comparing treat-all versus treat-none)\n",

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "Through this tutorial, I have demonstrated the usage of `MonteCarloGFormula` with *zEpid*. We want through an example of a time-varying treatment with two different time-varying confounders. For another example, please see the replication of Keil et al. 2014 using `MonteCarloGFormula`. You can follow along with the paper and the SAS code provided with the paper. Please view other tutorials for more information on functions in *zEpid*\n",
