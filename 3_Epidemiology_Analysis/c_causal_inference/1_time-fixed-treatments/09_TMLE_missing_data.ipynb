    "# Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimator\n",
    "The targeted maximum likelihood estimator (TMLE) is a doubly robust estimator. What distinguishes it from other doubly robust estimators (augmented-IPTW) is that it uses a secondary targeting (hence the name) step that optimizes the bias-variance tradeoff for the target parameter. A common target parameter is the sample average treatment effect, which compares to counterfactual where all individuals in the study sample were treated versus the counterfactual where no individual was treated. Throughout this section, I will use the notation that is common in the TMLE literature. This is a little different from the notation in other documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "The target parameter is defined as\n",
    "$$\\psi = E_L\\left[E\\left[Y^{a=1}|L\\right] - E\\left[Y^{a=0}|L\\right]\\right]$$\n",
    "We will focus on this parameter, but other estimates (like risk ratio and odds ratio) are also implemented\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial focuses on estimating TMLE with missing outcome data. I will demonstrate with both the default regression models and machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Missing Outcome Data\n",
    "To motivate our example, we will use a simulated data set included with *zEpid*. In the data set, we have a cohort of HIV-positive individuals. We are interested in the sample average treatment effect of antiretroviral therapy (ART) on all-cause mortality at 45-weeks. Based on substantive background knowledge, we believe that the treated and untreated populations are exchangeable based gender, age, CD4 T-cell count, and detectable viral load.\n",
    "\n",
    "While we conducted a complete-case analysis in the previous tutorial, TMLE can also natively handle missing outcome data. This is accomplished by using inverse probability of missing weights in the background. We can add this model by specifying the `missing_model()` function. \n",
    "\n",
    "To start, we will load our data and create some spline terms for age and CD4 T-cell count"

    "To accomodate missing outcome data, we proceed the previous process from the prior tutorial. However, this time we will also specify the `missing_model()` function. This model allows us to generate inverse probability of missing weights (IPMW) for the outcome. These weights are used to update the IPTW and the targeting process. Essentially, this procedure allows us to go from a missing completely at random assumption to the weaker assumption of missing at random. See Gruber, S., & van der Laan, M. J. (2011). tmle: An R package for targeted maximum likelihood estimation. for details on the procedure\n",
