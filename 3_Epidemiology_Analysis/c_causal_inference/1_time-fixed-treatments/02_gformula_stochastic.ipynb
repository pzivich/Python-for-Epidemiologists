    "In the previous tutorial we went over the basics of the parametric g-formula using `TimeFixedGFormula` for basic interventions. Additionally, we can use the g-formula to look at stochastic interventions. Stochastic interventions are treatment plans under which not necessarily everyone is treated, but some random percentage are treated.\n",

    "To estimate the g-formula for stochastic treatments, the process is fairly similar. However, instead of treating everyone, some percentage are treated. A random percentage are treated and then $\\hat{Y_i^a}$ are predicted and averaged. This process is repeated some number times and the average of the averaged potential outcomes is returned.\n",
